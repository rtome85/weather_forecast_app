ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
Please provide a comprehensive analysis and 6-8 diverse activity recommendations that:

1. **Weather Optimization**: Consider how current weather conditions affect each activity's enjoyability and safety
2. **Local Event Integration**: Incorporate relevant local events when they align with weather and user preferences
3. **Personalization**: Tailor suggestions based on user interests, budget, and activity preferences
4. **Diversity**: Include a balanced mix of indoor/outdoor, cultural/recreational, active/relaxed options
5. **Timing Consideration**: Factor in current time of day and optimal activity timing
6. **Practical Feasibility**: Ensure recommendations are realistic and accessible

For each recommendation, provide:
- Clear title and category classification
- Detailed description of the activity
- Reasoning for why it's suitable given current conditions
- Suitability score (1-10) based on weather, preferences, and timing
- Weather compatibility rating
- Estimated duration and price range
- Relevant tags for easy categorization

Additionally, provide:
- A weather summary explaining how conditions affect activity choices
- Location-specific insights about opportunities and considerations
- An overall recommendation strategy for making the most of the day

Focus on creating actionable, engaging suggestions that enhance the user's experience while considering safety, comfort, and personal preferences.`
